# social-network-api

## Description
In this project I created a social network API. This project helped me learn a lot about Mongoose and the mongo database. I also learned a new way of organizing the controllers and routes that I thought made it much easier to follow the code.

## Installation 
You will need to install the following dependencies.
    "dayjs": "^1.11.10",
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.3.2"

## Usage
To test the application you have to first seed the database by running the command "npm run seed" in the command line. Next you can start the server by running the command "npm start" in the command line. 
Once the app is seeded and started you can open insomnia to test all the routes. I have created a demonstration video you can view. The link is in the demo portion of this ReadMe.
